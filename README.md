# Fakeinator

A super tiny webpage for generating data with [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) and exporting as a CSV.

## Usage

Visit the [Fakeinator website](https://fakeinator.vercel.app) and select your column names and data types.

Once you've chosen your column names and data types, you can export the data as a CSV directly in the browser.

> **Warning**: there are definitely some data types that will cause errors at the moment since they expect arguments.
> and Fakeinator doesn't have any support for arguments (yet).
>
> If you come across a broken data type, please report it on GitHub.
